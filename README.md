## Prompt 1

What are the main differences between Flexbox and Grid layouts? Describe scenarios where each layout system would be more suitable.

### Response 1

## Prompt 2

What is the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items` in Flexbox? How does each property control the positioning of flex items within the container?

```
Justify-content aligns items along the main axis(horizontally), controlling space distribution within a container, while align-items aligns items along the cross axis(vertically), managing how items are placed relative to each other inside a container.
```

## Prompt 3

Describe the difference between `grid-template-areas` and `grid-template-columns`/`grid-template-rows`. When might you prefer one approach over the other?

### Response 3

## Prompt 4

Explain the `min-width` and `max-width` keywords in media queries. How do they help create responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes?

```
Min-width is used for if the screen/window is equal to or more than the given pixels, then the code in the query will trigger, while max-width is if the screen/window is equal to or less than the given pixels, then the code in the query will trigger. They help create responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes by how it makes specific elements for each screen size. You can make and add styles that will only apply to the screen sizes that are equal to the given pixels. It adds more customization and design, while also giving you more control over how you want your website to look in certain screens.
```

## Prompt 5

- An explanation of mobile first design and a few of the benefits of this approach
- A CSS code example demonstrating how to use media queries to adjust the layout of a container from mobile to desktop with either Flexbox or Grid (choose one).
- An explanation of the code example.
